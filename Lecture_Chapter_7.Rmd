# Loading packages that we will use

> Beware: *R* is a context-sensitive language. Thus, 'data' will be interpreted not in the same way as 'Data' will.

In *R* most functionality is provided by additional packages.\
Most of the packages are well-documented, See: <https://cran.r-project.org/>

The code chunk below first evaluates if the package [pacman](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacman/index.html) is already installed to your machine. If yes, the corresponding package will be loaded. If not, *R* will install the package.

Alternatively, you can do this manually first by executing *install.packages("pacman")* and then *library(pacman)*.

The second line then loads the package *pacman*

The third line uses the function *p_load()* from the pacman package to install (if necessary) and load all packages that we provide as arguments (e.g., [osfr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/osfr/index.html), which provides functions for interfacing with the open science framework from *R*).

```{r , warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, hide=TRUE}


if(!"pacman" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) install.packages("pacman")

library(pacman)

pacman::p_load(tidyverse, dplyr, tidyselect, sensR, SensoMineR)

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is the *R* session info which gives you information on my machine, all loaded packages and their version:

```{r  }

sessionInfo()

# Example for Discrimination test - Triangle test.

Triangle tests are very popular in sensory product research as tests for discrimination, and help to evaluate, whether consumers can significantly distinguish between product alternatives (see, e.g., \@Lawless.2010, chap. 4.4). In our lecture example on Lasagna variants, we observe the following results on the basis of n=100 consumers:

|              | Correctly identified odd sample | Incorrect response  |
|--------------|:-------------------------------:|:-------------------:|
| **Observed** |            43 (O~1~)            |      57 (O~2~)      |
| **Expected** |       33.$\bar{3}$ (E~1~)       | 66.$\bar{6}$ (E~2~) |

In our example, analysis draw on $\chi^{2}$-test (without continuity correction). Here, the test statistic is calculated as follows:

$\chi^{2}_{(1)}=\sum\frac{(observed-expected)^2}{expected}=[\frac{(O_{1}-E_{1})^2}{E_{1}}]+[\frac{(O_{2}-E_{2})^2}{E_{2}}]=[\frac{(43-33.\bar{3})^2}{33.\bar{3}}]+\frac{(57-66.\bar{6})^2}{66.\bar{6}}]=2.803+1.402=4.205$

We know from lectures in statistics that the df in a $\chi^{2}$-test equal: (number of rows -1) \* (number of columns -1). Thus, df=(2-1)\*(2-1)=1. The degrees of freedom are 1.

In *R*, for example the package [sensR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sensR/) is providing functions to handle nearly all types of discrimination tests, including Triangle tests (CITE). We will use the function **discrim()**. This function allows us to specify many arguments (see help by pressing 'F1'). We will do so for


* correct	= the number of correct answers
* total	= total number of responses
* conf.level = significance level (Type I error probability $\alpha$)
* method = the discrimination protocol applied (see lecture slides for the various options)
* statistic	= The type of analysis strategy to apply for the data (whether one wants to use normal distribution or ChiÂ² etc.)
* power	= Power of test (1 minus Type II error probability)

The function, furthermore, assumes us to set one of these arguments to **NULL**. By doing so, we tell the function to use the remaining 4 parameters to search for the value of the fifth. In our case, we are searching for 'N', therefore, we set 'N=NULL'.

We assign the results of our power analysis to a new object named 'results'. Then we call for its content.

```{r}

triangle_test <- discrim(
  correct= 43, 
  total= 100,
  conf.level = 0.95,
  method = "triangle", 
  statistic = "score",
  test = "difference")


print(triangle_test)


#plot(triangle_test)




```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

d.primePwr(d.primeA = 0.5454, 
           d.prime0 = 0, 
           sample.size = 100, 
           alpha = 0.05,
           method = "triangle", 
           test = "difference", statistic = "exact")



```
