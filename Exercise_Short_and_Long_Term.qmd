R analysis script presenting the solutions for the exercise in Sensory Marketing regarding Girard et al. [-@girard2019]. In one of the questions students are asked: How many respondents should one at minimum calculate for a replication of study 1's results regarding perceived service value? Assumptions: equal split to scent vs. no scent conditions, $\alpha$=5%, $\beta$=5%, between-subjects ANOVA).

The purpose of this script does not solely lay in answering the exercise question. Moreover, studying these scripts should students make become familiar with some aspects of working in *R*.

## Beware!

*R* is a context-sensitive language. Thus, 'data' will be interpreted not in the same way as 'Data' will.
:::

In *R* most functionality is provided by additional packages.\
Most of the packages are well-documented, see: <https://cran.r-project.org/>

1.  The code chunk below first evaluates if the package [pacman](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacman/index.html) [@pacman] is already installed on your machine. If yes, the corresponding package will be loaded. If not, *R* will install the package.

2.  Alternatively, you can do this manually first by executing *install.packages("pacman")* and then *library(pacman)*.

3.  The second line then loads the package [pacman](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacman/index.html).

4.  The third line uses the function *p_load()* from the pacman package to install (if necessary) and loads all packages that we provide as arguments (e.g., [pwr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/) [@pwr], which provides functions for statistical power calculations).

```{r}



if (!"pacman" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) install.packages("pacman")

library(pacman)

pacman::p_load(tidyverse, pwr, compute.es)

# Finding an answer to question #9

How many respondents should one at minimum calculate for a replication of Study 1's results regarding perceived service value? Assumptions: equal split to scent vs. no scent conditions, $\alpha$=5%, $\beta$=5%, between-subjects ANOVA).

We use an ANOVA here.

## Calculate effect size Cohen's f

We have seen from our exercise that the program [G\*Power](http://www.psychologie.hhu.de/arbeitsgruppen/allgemeine-psychologie-und-arbeitspsychologie/gpower.html) [@faul2007] requires the effect size measure Cohen's f [@Cohen.1988]. The same holds for the [pwr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/index.html) package [@pwr], which we will, again, use to conduct power analysis in *R*. Therefore, we first need to convert information provided by the *JSR* article into a sample estimate of f.

Information the article provides:

*"\[...\] and service value, M*<sub>scented</sub> = 3.69, SD = 1.37 versus M<sub>unscented</sub> = 3.05, SD = 1.38, F(1, 195) = 14.521, p \< .001, $\eta^{2}_{p}$ = .069, than those in the unscented condition, \[...\]"

From this, we can extract:

-   the effective net sample size (n-k)=195, thus n=197 since we compare 2 groups
-   The alternative effect size measure $\eta^{2}_{p}$, which is 0.069
-   The F-value, which is 14.521

This is all that we need to first calculate the observed effect size Cohen's f [@Cohen.1988]. According the Cohen [-@Cohen.1988, p. 281] $\eta^{2}_{p}$ can easily be converted to f by a simple formula: f= $\sqrt{\frac{\eta^{2}}{1-\eta^{2}}}$ Therefore, we need to solve $\sqrt{\frac{0.069}{1-0.069}}$

We achieve this by using the next code chunk. Within this code chunk, we use the *sqrt()* function (place the cursor in the function and press 'F1' to see help), which calculates the square root of a number. We feed this function with the value of $\eta^{2}_{p}$=0.069. We assign the results to an object that we call 'Cohen_f'.

In the next line, we call the object and simultaneously round the results to 4 digits. This is obtained by using the *round()* function.

```{r}

Cohen_f <- sqrt(0.069 / (1 - 0.069))

round(Cohen_f, digits = 4)

```

::: callout-tip
## We can see that the calculated effect size `r round(Cohen_f, digits = 4)` perfectly mirrors the one we have seen in the exercise slides using G\*Power.

A common classification for Cohen's f is: \[0.1 \| 0.25\[ - small effect, \[0.25 \| 0.4\[ - medium effect, and \[0.4 \| 1\] - large effect.

## Conduct A priori power analysis to search for minimum n

In the question, we are asked for $\beta$=5%, which corresponds to a statistical power of 95%.

To estimate a minimum sample size *n* for the replication, we apply the *pwr.anova.test()* function from the [pwr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/index.html) package. This function needs us to provide 5 arguments to fill its parameters. These are (see help by pressing 'F1'):

-   k = The number of groups to compare (i.e., 2)
-   n = Number of observations (per group) and we are assuming that we will be able to allocate participants in a way that both groups are of equal size (called balanced)
-   f = Effect size Cohen's f
-   sig.level = Significance level (Type I error probability $\alpha$)
-   power = Power of test (1 minus Type II error probability)

The function, furthermore, assumes us to set one of these arguments to **NULL**. By doing so, we tell the function to use the remaining 4 parameters to search for the value of the fifth. In our case, we are searching for 'n', therefore, we set 'n=NULL'.

We assign the results of our power analysis to a new object named 'results'. Then we call for its content.

```{r results='asis'}

results <- pwr.anova.test(k = 2, n = NULL, f = Cohen_f, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.95)

results

```

We can see that the calculated sample size per group `r results$n` only closely mirrors the one we have seen in G\*Power 3 [@faul2007] at n=89. We have to round upwards to end up with `r ceiling(results$n)`. For the total sample size, we just multiply by 2, which gives `r ceiling(results$n)+ceiling(results$n)`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Visualize results

In a last step, we can visualize the relationship between the expected statistical power and different sample sizes.

For this purpose, we apply the *plot()* function with the 'results' object and a catchy label for the x-axes as arguments.

```{r}

plot(results, xlab = "sample size")

```

From this plot, we can alternatively extract the same information for sample size planning.
