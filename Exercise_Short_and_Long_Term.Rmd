R analysis script presenting the solutions for the exercise in Sensory Marketing regarding Girard et al. [-@Girard.2019]. In one of the questions students are asked: How many respondents should one at minimum calculate for a replication of study 1's results regarding perceived service value? Assumptions: equal split to scent vs. no scent conditions, $\alpha$=5%, $\beta$=5%, between-subjects ANOVA).

# Loading packages that we will use

> Beware: *R* is a context-sensitive language. Thus, 'data' will be interpreted not in the same way as 'Data' will.

In *R* most functionality is provided by additional packages.\
Most of the packages are well-documented, See: <https://cran.r-project.org/>

The code chunk below first evaluates if the package [pacman](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacman/index.html) is already installed to your machine. If yes, the corresponding package will be loaded. If not, *R* will install the package.

Alternatively, you can do this manually first by executing *install.packages("pacman")* and then *library(pacman)*.

The second line then loads the package *pacman*

The third line uses the function *p_load()* from the pacman package to install (if necessary) and load all packages that we provide as arguments (e.g., [pwr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/index.html), which provides functions for *power analysis*).

```{r , warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


if(!"pacman" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) install.packages("pacman")

library(pacman)

pacman::p_load(tidyverse, dplyr, pwr, tidyselect, compute.es, WebPower)


```

Here is the *R* session info which gives you information on my machine, all loaded packages and their version:

```{r  }

# Finding an answer to question \#9

> How many respondents should one at minimum calculate for a replication of study 1's results regarding perceived service value? Assumptions: equal split to scent vs. no scent conditions, $\alpha$=5%, $\beta$=5%, between-subjects ANOVA)

We use an ANOVA here.

## Calculate effect size Cohen's f [@Cohen.1988]

We have seen from our exercise that the program [G\*Power](http://www.psychologie.hhu.de/arbeitsgruppen/allgemeine-psychologie-und-arbeitspsychologie/gpower.html) requires the effect size measure Cohen's f [@Cohen.1988]. The same hold for the [pwr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/index.html) package, which we will, again, use to conduct power analysis in *R*. Therefore, we first need to convert information provided by the *JSR* article into a sample estimate of f.

Information the article provides:

*"[...] and service value, M*<sub>scented</sub> = 3.69, SD = 1.37 versus M<sub>unscented</sub> = 3.05, SD = 1.38, F(1, 195) = 14.521, p \< .001, $\eta^{2}_{p}$ = .069, than those in the unscented condition, [...]"

From this we are able to extract:

-   the effective net sample size (n-k)=195, thus n=197 since we compare 2 groups (this was mainly a paper and pen experiment with some missing data)\
-   The alternative effect size measure $\eta^{2}_{p}$, which is 0.069
-   the The F-value, which is 14.521

This is all that we need to first calculate the observed effect size Cohen's f [@Cohen.1988]. According the Cohen [-@Cohen.1988, p. 281] $\eta^{2}_{p}$ can easily be converted to f by a simple formula: f= $\sqrt{\frac{\eta^{2}}{1-\eta^{2}}}$ Therefore, we need to solve $\sqrt{\frac{0.069}{1-0.069}}$

We achieve this by using the next code chunk. Within this code chunk we use the *sqrt()* function (place the cursor in the function and press 'F1' to see help), which calculates the square root of a number. We feed this function with the value of $\eta^{2}_{p}$=0.069. We assign the results to an object that we call 'Cohen_f'.

In the next line we call the object and simultaneously round the results to 4 digits. This is obtained by using the *round()* function.

```{r}

Cohen_f <- sqrt(0.069 / (1 - 0.069))

round(Cohen_f, digits = 4)

```

> We can see that the calculated effect size `r round(Cohen_f, digits = 4)` perfectly mirrors the one we have seen in the exercise slides using G\*Power. A common classification for Cohen's f is: [0.1 \| 0.25[ - small effect, [0.25 \| 0.4[ - medium effect, and [0.4 \| 1] - large effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conduct A priori power analysis to search for minimum n

In the question we are asked for $\beta$=5%, which corresponds to a statistical power of 95%.

To estimate a minimum sample size n for the replication we apply the *pwr.anova.test()* function from the [pwr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/index.html) package. This function needs us to provide 5 arguments to fill its parameters. These are (see help by pressing 'F1'):

-   k = The number of groups to compare (2)
-   n = Number of observations (per group) and we are assuming that we will be able to allocate participants in a way that both groups are of equal size (called balanced)
-   f = Effect size Cohen's f
-   sig.level = Significance level (Type I error probability $\alpha$)
-   power = Power of test (1 minus Type II error probability)

The function, furthermore, assumes us to set one of these arguments to **NULL**. By doing so, we tell the function to use the remaining 4 parameters to search for the value of the fifth. In our case, we are searching for 'n', therefore, we set 'n=NULL'.

We assign the results of our power analysis to a new object named 'results'. Then we call for its content.

```{r results='asis'}

results <- pwr.anova.test(k = 2, n = NULL, f = Cohen_f, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.95)

results

```

> We can see that the calculated sample size per group `r results$n` only closely mirrors the one we have seen in G\*Power 3 [@Faul.2007] at n=89. We have to round upwards to end up with `r ceiling(results$n)`. For the total sample size, we just multiply by 2, which gives `r ceiling(results$n)+ceiling(results$n)`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Visualize results

In a last step we can visualize the relationship between the expected statistical power and different sample sizes.

For this purpose we apply the *plot()* function with the 'results' object and a catchy label for the x-axes as arguments.

```{r}

plot(results, xlab = "sample size")

```

> From this plot we can alternatively extract the same information for sample size planning.
