R analysis script presenting part of the solutions for exercise #1 in Sensory Marketing and Product Innovation regarding Li, Heuvinck, & Pandelaere [-@li2021]. In one of the questions, students are asked to estimate the appropriate sample size to replicate Study 1's findings (under $\alpha$=5%, Power=0.8).

The purpose of this script is not solely to answer the exercise question. Moreover, studying these scripts should help students become familiar with some aspects of working in *R*.

## Beware!

*R* is a context-sensitive language. Thus, 'data' will not be interpreted the same way as 'Data'.
:::

In *R* most functionality is provided by additional packages.\
Most of the packages are well-documented; see: <https://cran.r-project.org/>

1.  The code chunk below first evaluates if the package [pacman](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacman/index.html) [@pacman] has already been installed on your machine. If yes, the corresponding package will be loaded. If not, *R* will install the package.

2.  Alternatively, you can do this manually first by executing *install.packages("pacman")* and then *library(pacman)*.

3.  The second line then loads the package [pacman](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacman/index.html).

4.  The third line uses the function *p_load()* from the pacman package to install (if necessary) and loads all packages that we provide as arguments (e.g., [pwr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/) [@pwr], which provides functions for statistical power calculations).

```{r}



if (!"pacman" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) install.packages("pacman")

library(pacman)

pacman::p_load(tidyverse, pwr, compute.es)

```

# Finding an answer to question #4

For your master‚Äôs thesis, it might be a good idea to replicate the IAT findings of Study 1 (D-score \> 0, t-test). Based on a power analysis (Assumptions: ùõº=5%, Power=0.8), how many subjects should you recruit for this study?

## Extract information on the effect size Cohen's d and the statistical analysis procedure

Information the article provides on page 3:

*The D-score was significantly greater than 0 (D = 0.45, SD = 0.47, t(133) = 10.98, p \< .001, 95% CI = \[0.37, 0.53\], Cohen's d = 0.95), suggesting that participants responded significantly faster in assigning the stimuli when healthy and light were grouped together.*

From this, we can extract:

-   The effect size measure Cohen's d equals 0.95.
-   For analysis, the authors applied a one-sample t-test, which tests against the constant value of 0.

## Conduct an a priori power analysis to search for minimum n

The question asks us for a statistical power of 80% (a commonly used threshold in social sciences).

To estimate a minimum sample size *n* for the replication, we apply the *pwr.t.test()* function from the [pwr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/index.html) package. This function needs us to provide six arguments to fill its parameters. These are (see help by pressing 'F1' when setting the cursor into the function's name):

-   d = Effect size Cohen's d (see, e.g., Cohen [-@cohen2013])
-   n = Total number of observations
-   sig.level = Significance level (Type I error probability $\alpha$)
-   power = Power of test (1 minus Type II error probability)
-   type = Type of t-test: one- ("one.sample") two- ("two.sample") or paired-samples ("paired")
-   alternative = parameter indicating the test strategy: one of "two.sided" (default), "greater" or "less"

The function, furthermore, assumes us to set one of the arguments (d, n, sig.level, or power) to **NULL**. By doing so, we tell the function to use the remaining 5 parameters to search for the sixth value. In our case, we are searching for 'n', therefore, we set 'n=NULL'. Furthermore, we are using a one-sample t-test, and the original study expects the d score to be greater than 0. Therefore, we set alternative to "greater".

We assign the results of our power analysis to a new object named 'results'. Then we call for its content.

```{r results='asis'}

results <- pwr.t.test(d = 0.95, n = NULL, type = "one.sample", sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.8, alternative = "greater")

results

```

We can see that the (conservatively rounded) calculated sample size `r ceiling(results$n)` perfectly mirrors the one we have seen in G\*Power 3 [@faul2007]. As discussed in our exercise, the study authors applied standard exclusion criteria for IAT procedures. Therefore, 1.49 times the sample size estimate (1.49 times 9 = `r ceiling(1.49*9)`) would be necessary to end at n = 9 in the net sample.

Remember that if an original study has a very large effect size, a replication with 80% power often requires fewer subjects than the original study. However, studies reporting only small effects typically need many more participants for success replication.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Additional reading *(not relevant for the exam)*

In the above-discussed example, we were planning to replicate the original findings. In doing so, we have made certain assumptions:

We assume that the observed effect size Cohen's d = 0.95 is the true effect size to find. Strictly speaking, this is wrong. Our calculated value is only a sample estimate of the true effect size in the underlying population. Under the assumption of knowing the true effect size, we calculated that we need at least n=`r ceiling(9*1.49)` participants for a replication of the original findings with a power of 80%. This means that we will have approximately the chance of 80% to find the effect to be significant at $\alpha$=0.05. Because, the true effect to find might, however, be smaller, this calculation may present an overly optimistic approach. Therefore, other researchers prefer to focus on the confidence intervals for the estimate of effect size measures [@thompson2002].

To estimate the lower limit of the observed Cohen's d, we can apply a formula proposed by Hedges & Olkin [-@Hedges1985]:

$d \pm se * z_{crit}$

Where *se* is the standard error given by:

$se = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}+\frac{d^{2}}{2n}}$

and $z_{crit}$ is given by the standard normal distribution at p = 0.95 ($\alpha$ = 5%).

Let us first calculate **se**. Table 4 in the article informs that n = 134 participants were used for analysis.

```{r}

se <- sqrt((1/134)+((0.95*0.95)/(2*134)))

se

```

Next, determine the critical z-value ($\alpha$ = 5%). For this purpose, we use the *qnorm()* function. We only have to provide the probability (95%) and the mean and standard deviation.

```{r}

z_crit <- qnorm(p = 0.95, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE)

z_crit

```

Finally, we calculate the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of Cohen's d:

```{r}

d_lower95 <- 0.95 -se*z_crit

d_lower95


```

The results tell us which lower Cohen's d to expect in the underlying population (`r round(d_lower95, digits = 2)`). This is an alternative to the classical t-test. If we reach a significant result here (i.e., the lower limit is not crossing 0), this means that the effect size obtained is significantly greater than 0. Put differently, the effect is assumed to exist in the underlying population. Researchers in the context effect domain are starting to report tests on effect sizes, especially when their articles span multiple studies [@evangelidis2018].

We can briefly calculate how this will change our assumptions about the minimum sample size. Again, we use the *pwr.t.test()* function (see above). This time, we hand in **d_lower95** as the argument for the effect size parameter d.

```{r results='asis'}

results_worst_case <- pwr.t.test(d = d_lower95, n = NULL, type = "one.sample", sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.8, alternative = "greater") 

results_worst_case 

```

We can see that the more conservative sample size is `r ceiling(results_worst_case$n)`. Combined with the abovementioned exclusion factor, we end at a (worst-case) gross sample n of `r ceiling(1.49*results_worst_case$n)`.
